        <h3>Bio:</h3>

        <p class="links">
            My name is Edy and I am 26 years old. I have had training at <a href="https://www.nmsu.edu/" target="_blank">New Mexico State Univerity</a>
            I am very close to obtaining my BA in Computer science. My current favorite things 
            in computer science are pointers, and OOP. I have a lot of useless knowledge. But 
            ask me about certain things. You are likely to get a good answer from me from the following: Ask me about
            Optometry, Ophthalmology, Astronomy, physics, astrophysics, and math. I am currently attempting to obtain my CCNA.
            My career hope is that I obtatin a job that has something to with a blending of Computer Science and Computer Networks.
            Currently, I am learning about machine learning, and obtaining my CCNA. 
            I have spent about a year in the NMSU Choir.
